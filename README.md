This is a comparartive analysis expansion of Covid-19 in China and rest of the world, dataset has been acquired from Datacamp.
When i plotted cumulative cases worldwide wrt date of cases being reported, i got to see that from mid jan to 12 or 13 of feb there was a constant increase in cases but there was a sudden dip in number of cases but after that cases went high exponentially. Beyond march 15th cases had reached to almost 200000.

When a comparison was made between China and rest of the world we could see that till feb last week China had hit its peak and after that the curve started becoming flat. But for other countiries situtaion worsened. As after march 1st, cases grew exponentially and had shown no control.

Some important dates that were being reported by WHO were 30th Jan 2020- Global Health emergency was declared, 13th Feb 2020- China started reporting and 11th march 2020, Coronavirus Outbreak was declared as Pandemic. So we could infer that after 11th March it grew drastically in other countries.

When we tried analysing number of cases in China after 15th feb, we could see growth curve getting flattened after March 10th while comparing it to countires other then China, it went exponnetially high.

Talking baout the top 7 countries outside china those were hardest hit in the above duration are Italy, France, Germany, Iran, US, Spain, South Korea.
